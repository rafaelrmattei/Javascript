# 🧠 JavaScript Study Projects

This repository contains various projects developed during my learning journey with vanilla JavaScript. Each project was built to practice key concepts like logic, DOM manipulation, events, user interaction, API consumption, and building small web applications.

The projects run directly in the browser and require no installation.
